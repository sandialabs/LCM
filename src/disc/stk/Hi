’d like to virtually introduce you to Jacob Needels, a new post doc who started last week in 8738.  Jacob will be working with Patrick on multi-fidelity and ROM methods for aero-thermal problems.  Like you and I, Jacob is a Stanford alumnus – he was Juan Alonso’s student and recently graduated.  I also realized just now on LinkedIn that both of you went to UC Davis for undergrad.

Anyway, I will let the two of you set up a time to chat if you’d like.  Jacob is on site, so you can probably meet him in person next time you drive in, Jerry.
